      "Industry Session on Tendering and HC-1 2003 Presenters: Marko Misko, Clayton Utz Bob Baird, Director Construction Contracts, DOD Katrina Fields, Deputy Director, DOD These slides have been prepared solely for the purpose of assisting IAD to provide an overview, at its national industry information sessions, of the key features of its procurement processes and standard form Head Contract HC-1 2003. As an overview, the slides seek to summarise much important information, and are not a complete explanation of all of the features of those processes or that contract. They should therefore not be relied on for any purpose, or used as a substitute for detailed legal advice on any issue of concern. Defence has issued these slides on the basis that it takes no responsibility for any errors, ambiguities, inconsistencies or omissions in the slides. Nothing in the slides is intended to have any legal effect or to in any way alter or affect the rights and obligations of any party to a procurement process run by IAD or a contract awarded by IAD. If any issue is identified in the slides, then it should be referred to IAD , Deputy Director Construction Contracts 02 6266 8147 Introductions and Housekeeping Defence Infrastructure overview Invitations to Register Interest Tendering – HC 1 2003 Overview of HC-1 2003 Who are we?

Everything else is probably unnecessary Conditional language in covering letters Provide standard list of exclusions in pricing schedules Use standard pricing schedule that limits the validity period of the tender Insert TBA in miscellaneous contract particulars The following examples may not result in non-conformance but will slow evaluation or impact your assessment: Fail to provide a response Fail to provide a signature Fail to attach the relevant industrial instrument or DEEWR letter Recycle the last submission with references to different projects as the methodology Fail to comply with timeframes in any request for clarification 1 contract form – 3 delivery methods Presenters: Marko Misko, Partner, Clayton Utz Bob Baird, Director Construction Contracts, DOD Katrina Fields, Deputy Director, DOD In this session you will develop an awareness of: Key features of HC 1 2003 Why it is not an AS contract Risk allocation basics Business Tools and support materials Three delivery methods provided for under HC 1 2003: Design and Construct Document and Construct Construct only Relationship Traditional Target Date & Target Cost Fixed Time & Fixed Cost Agent of the Commonwealth Not a superintendent, or independent certifier Must act within authority of contract Issues directions and makes determinations Unless a Variation Order is given by Contract Administrator or the Contractor can substantiate a Claim Comply with programming obligations Variation Latent Conditions ( if applicable) Act of Prevention Breach of Contract Delayed access to Site Suspension Acceleration Direction which Contractor believes is a Variation Change in law Contract Administrator has broad powers to issue directions under the Contract Ideally, will be in scope Sometimes, Contractors consider the direction to constitute a Variation Notices provision sets out the procedural requirements to keep an entitlement alive Provides for a bar on claims that are not brought “within time” Purpose is to ensure claims are raised in timely manner Important that you examine how you will manage this risk Commonwealth can only make payment for claims due and payable Example of broad right of CA to issue directions Where construct only, will seek the relevant information or direct action in accordance with documents Often may be directed to the buildability provisions Recognise the need to respond expediently to allow you to progress the works Not all acts of prevention are breaches of contract Commonwealth accepts responsibility for effects of acts of prevention on program Unilateral right to extend the Date for Completion No agreed damages payable for these events May be an entitlement to extra costs In response to a claim for EOT, the CA may give an instruction to accelerate Increasingly may become more prevalent in Defence contracts with capability driven projects Pre-agreed margin tendered to be applied to extra cost reasonably incurred Liquidated Damages are not affected by the instruction Existing conditions and geotechnical What is the site?

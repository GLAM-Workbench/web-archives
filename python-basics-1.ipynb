    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is the fastest-growing language in computer programming. Learning [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is a great choice because [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n",
    "* Regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n",
    "* Flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data \n",
    "* A skill desired by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r). We plan to create additional support for learning [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r) soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r), please reach out to Nathan Kelber (nathan.kelber@ithaka.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you'll learn in *Python Basics* 1-3 are general-purpose [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. They are also widely applicable to many other kinds of tasks in [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) beyond text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Making Mistakes is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of Python programming is an [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) using an [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator). An [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator) in this case is `+`, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the \"Run\" button or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code."

    "\n",
    "All [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluate to a single value. In the above examples, our [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluated to single numerical value. Numerical values come in two basic forms:\n",

    "\n",
    "An [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), what we sometimes call a \"whole number\", is a number without a decimal point that can be positive or negative. When a value uses a decimal, it is called a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float) or floating-point number. Two numbers that are mathematically equivalent could be in two different data types. For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) while the latter is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n",

    "Of course, [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can be written with single or double quotes. A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), 5.0 is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but '5' and '5.0' are [strings](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can also be blank, such as ''.\n",

    "\n",
    "The distinction between each of these data types may seem unimportant, but [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) treats each one differently. For example, we can ask [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) whether an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) is equal to a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but we cannot ask whether a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) is equal to an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) or a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n",

If you break those rules, your code will create an error and fail to execute properly. There are also style *guidelines* that, while they won't break your code, are generally advised for making your code readable and understandable. These style guidelines are written in the [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",

    "If you have written code before, you may be familiar with other styles, but these notebooks will attempt to follow the PEP guidelines for style. Ultimately, the most important thing is that your [variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#variable) names are consistent so that someone who reads your code can follow what it is doing. As your code becomes more complicated, writing detailed comments with `#` will also become more important."

    "Many different kinds of programs often need to do very similar operations. Instead of writing the same code over again, you can use a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function). Essentially, a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) is a small snippet of code that can be quickly referenced. There are three kinds of [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function):\n",

One of the most common [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) used in [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is the `print()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) which simply prints a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string)."

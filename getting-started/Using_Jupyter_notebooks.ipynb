You've learnt how to run and edit cells, but you've also harvested some data from an API, created a dataset, visualised the dataset, and saved it as a CSV file. As you work through the GLAM Workbench you'll find yourself repeating this sort of pattern â€“ getting, analysing, and saving data. You've also met some important tools like Requests, Pandas, and Altair. Once again you'll find them popping up all over the place. The examples used in this notebook might have been pretty simple, but they provide a good introduction to what the GLAM Workbench is all about.\n",

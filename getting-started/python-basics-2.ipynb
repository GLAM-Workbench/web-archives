    "\n",
    "In *Python Basics 1*, you learned about [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression), [operators](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator), [variables](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#variable), and a few native [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#). We wrote programs that executed line-by-line, starting at the top and running to the bottom. This approach works great for simple programs that may execute a few tasks, but as you begin writing programs that can do multiple tasks you'll need a way for your programs to decide which action comes next. We can control when (or if) code gets executed with [flow control statements](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#flow-control-statement). If a program is a set of steps for accomplishing a task, then [flow control statements](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) help the program decide the next action.\n",

    "[Flow control statements](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) work like a flowchart. For example, let's say your goal is to hang out and relax with friends. There are a number of steps you might take, depending on whether your friends are available or you feel like making some new friends.\n",

You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses `()` where [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument) can be **passed** into the function. Depending on the [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) (and your goals for using it), a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) may accept no [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument), a single [argument](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument), or many [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument). For example, when we use the `print()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function), a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) (or a variable containing a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string)) is passed as an [argument](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument).\n",

We don't need to know all the details of how the `print()` [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) works in order to use it. [Functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an [argument](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument) into the box and a **return value** comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) work.

This can cause weird errors in our programs that are hard to track down. We can alleviate the problem of duplicate [variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#variable) names through the concepts of [local scope](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#local-scope) and [global scope](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-scope).\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we can also create [global variables](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#global-variable) that persist at the top-level of the program *and* within the [local scope](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#local-scope) of a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function).\n",

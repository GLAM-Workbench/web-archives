    "\n",
    "In this step we'll convert the Powerpoint files to PDFs. PDFs are easier to work with, and we can use them to extract text and images from the original presentation files. However, the conversion process can be a bit fiddly. Before you undertake this you'll need to make sure that you have a **recent version of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) installed** on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using this notebook on Binder, or have created a `virtualenv` using this repository's `requirements.txt`, you'll have installed the Python command-line program `unoconv`. Unoconv wraps around LibreOffice to provide a standard interface for converting files from one file type to another. However, while `unoconv` seems to work ok when running a notebook in a conda environment, it fails in a standard `virtualenv`. It's got something to do with the default interpreter, but even using LibreOffice's own packaged Python doesn't seem to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, you can just call LibreOffice directly. To do this, you'll need to know the location of the LibreOffice program. for example, on MacOS this is probably `/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice`. Once you have that, it's easy to convert a directory full of Powerpoint files to pdfs, for example:\n",

    "I've included both the `unoconv` and direct LibreOffice options below so you can use the one that works best for you. Just comment/uncomment lines as necessary. **If you're using this notebook on Binder, it *should just work* with the default settings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both commands might fail silently if LibreOffice is already running on your system – close it first! If a previous call to LibreOffice has failed in some ugly way, it might still be running in the background, so if nothing seems to be happening, hunt around for a running LibreOffice process.\n",
    "* Both commands might fail in unhelpful ways on corrupted or malformed Powerpoints. If you keep getting stuck on a particular file, just try moving or deleting it and then run the conversion command again.\n",
    "* I've seen reports that suggest the comands might fail if you feed in lots of files. I've processed > 100 without problem, but if this does happen it might be necessary to loop through individual files, or break them up into groups.\n",
    "* Because of missing fonts or general weirdness, the PDFs are unlikely to be exact representations of the Powerpoint files. But the point of this exercise is to give some insight into the contents of the files, rather than create perfectly styled PDFs. Again, you'll probably get better results running on your local machine where you've got a range of fonts installed.\n",
